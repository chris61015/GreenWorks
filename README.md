What needs to be done for Show_and_Tell_1?


You are encouraged to present the MVC diagram (e.g., drawn on paper, in a slide) that shows all the app and backend (if applicable) components.  If you decide not to do so, you need find a way to visualize your components. 
You need to present a demonstration of some of the project components -- e.g., parts of the UI, controllers, databases, backend (see FAQ on demoing tech)
Discuss who is doing what.
Describe what demo will be shown at the Show_and_Tell_2. This is not binding but will allow XD to give feedback.

You need to present  a threaded design diagram -- that shows all the threads in the project, that is, which components run on the UI thread and which components run off the UI thread.
